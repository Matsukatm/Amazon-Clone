This Amazon clone project, built using HTML and CSS, demonstrates the fundamental structure and styling needed to replicate a large e-commerce platform.
The objective of this project is to understand and implement the key features and design elements that contribute to Amazon’s success in the e-commerce domain.
While it lacks interactivity and dynamic content, it provides a solid foundation for understanding how such a site is constructed and styled.
Adding Python would significantly enhance its functionality, making it a more realistic and usable application.
The scope of this project encompasses the development of a static website using HTML for structure, CSS for styling.
The use of external libraries, such as Font Awesome for icons, enhances the visual appeal and functionality of the site.
The website aims to mimic Amazon’s layout, including a navigation bar, search box, promotional hero section, product cards, and footer.
The project utilizes HTML for creating the structure of the web pages, defining the layout, and organizing content.
CSS is employed to style the elements, providing a visually cohesive and aesthetically pleasing appearance.
External resources like the Font Awesome library and Google Fonts enhance the overall design and user experience.
